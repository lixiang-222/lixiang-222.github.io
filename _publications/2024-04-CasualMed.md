Medication recommendation systems are designed to deliver personalized drug suggestions that are closely aligned with
individual patient needs. Previous studies have primarily concentrated on developing medication embeddings, achieving
significant progress. Nonetheless, these approaches often fall short in accurately reflecting individual patient
profiles, mainly due to challenges in distinguishing between various patient conditions and the inability to establish
precise correlations between specific conditions and appropriate medications. In response to these issues, we introduce
DisMed, a model that focuses on patient conditions to enhance personalization. DisMed employs causal inference to
discern clear, quantifiable causal links. It then examines patient conditions in depth, recognizing and adapting to the
evolving nuances of these conditions, and mapping them directly to corresponding medications. Additionally, DisMed
leverages data from multiple patient visits to propose combinations of medications. Comprehensive testing on real-world
datasets demonstrates that DisMed not only improves the customization of patient profiles but also surpasses leading
models in both precision and safety.
